# Hackathon101 Code Samples

Within this repository you will find some simple example webapps that show you how to make an API request and display the result on an HTML webpage.

There are THOUSANDS of APIs out there - here are some examples: https://any-api.com/

During the Hackathon you will be working in teams so it is important that you are able to collaborate. A good starting point is to familiarise yourself with Github: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

The example webapps have very little styling applied to them, but of course you can make your webapps look as pretty as you'd like! There are plenty of resources out there explaining CSS basics, here is one: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/p/css-basics

If you have some experience developing webapps and would like to build something more in-depth over the weekend, a good starting point might be to use a resource such as http://megaboilerplate.com/ which takes out some of the setup hassle.

We hope that you find the Hackathon experience valuable and have an awesome weekend making some cool projects! :-)
